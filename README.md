# UZR Leverage

A smart contract system for recursive leverage and deleverage operations on the UZR Lending Market, with a Next.js frontend interface.

## Overview

UZR Leverage automates recursive leverage and deleverage operations on the UZR Lending Market. The system enables users to:

- **Increase leverage** by recursively supplying collateral, borrowing, and swapping tokens
- **Decrease leverage** by repaying debt, withdrawing collateral, and swapping tokens
- **Manage positions** through a web-based interface with real-time position tracking

## Key Components

### Smart Contract (`contract/src/UZRLeverage.sol`)

The core contract that handles leverage operations:
- **Leverage**: Recursively supplies collateral, borrows at 88% LTV, and swaps USD0→BUSD0
- **Unleverage**: Repays debt, withdraws collateral, and swaps BUSD0→USD0
- **Integration**: Uses Uniswap Universal Router V4 for token swaps via Permit2

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

A Next.js web application with:
- **Wallet Connection**: Support for injected wallets (Rabby, MetaMask, etc.)
- **Contract Deployment**: Deploy UZRLeverage contracts directly from the UI
- **Leverage Controls**: Execute leverage/unleverage operations with configurable iterations
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time display of user positions, balances, and health factors
- **Authorization**: Manage contract authorizations on the lending market

## Features

- ✅ Recursive leverage operations with configurable iterations
- ✅ Recursive deleverage operations
- ✅ Automatic token swaps via Uniswap V4
- ✅ Real-time position tracking and balances
- ✅ Slippage protection on swaps
- ✅ User-friendly web interface with futuristic dark theme
- ✅ Contract authorization management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Foundry (for contract development)
- Web3 wallet (Rabby, MetaMask, etc.)
- Access to Ethereum Mainnet

### Contract

```bash
cd contract
forge build
forge test
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the [contract documentation](contract/UZRLeverage.md) and [frontend README](frontend/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Technical Details

- **Solidity**: 0.8.30
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Web3**: Wagmi, Viem
- **Testing**: Foundry
- **Network**: Ethereum Mainnet

## Market Configuration

- **Collateral Token**: BUSD0
- **Loan Token**: USD0
- **LTV**: 88% (0.88)
- **Liquidation LTV**: 99.99% (0.9999)
- **Uniswap Pool Fee**: 0.01% (100)

## Security Considerations

- This software is **experimental and unaudited**
- Always verify contract addresses before use
- Review all transactions carefully
- Be aware of liquidation risks when using leverage
- Interest accrues on borrowed amounts, increasing debt over time
